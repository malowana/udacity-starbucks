<b> 1. Description </b><br>
This project is a part of Udacity course. The aim of this project was to analyze Purchasing decissions of Starbucks clients, familiarize with data. Moreover, final part was to create ML model, which will predict if user who receive bogo or discount offer will complete it or not in time

In [feature_engineering.ipynb](https://github.com/malowana/udacity-starbucks/blob/main/feature%20engineering.ipynb) I familiarized with json files, created new features and joined all files to one. <br>
In [Starbucks_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/malowana/udacity-starbucks/blob/main/Starbucks_analysis.ipynb) I made an analysis used in the Medium article.  <br>
In [modelling.ipynb](https://github.com/malowana/udacity-starbucks/blob/main/modelling.ipynb) I built ML models, which predict if offer will be completed by customer or not. The best model - XGBoost with default parameters received precission of 0.73 <br>
 <br>
